Focus time is an application in python to help you focus for a set amount of time. It checks in on you at random intervals to ask if you are focusing, and uses your responses to estimate how much high-quality focus time you have completed so far.

## Installation
```
pip install focus-time
```
- Tested for use with Python 3.6 and 3.8. Currently working on Windows 10; support for Linux and MacOS upcoming. 
- Requires: any terminal that is configured to run Python packages (tested on Anaconda prompt, powershell, command prompt). 
- Optional first step: create a new conda environment to install focus-time into, e.g. use the command `conda create --focus myenv`
- In Windows: right-click the title bar of the terminal GUI, click properties, and uncheck QuickEdit Mode if applicable. With QuickEdit Mode, certain clicking actions cause the terminal to freeze

## Focus session
1. To start a focus session, simply turn on your sound, turn off your phone, and write the command in your terminal, within the environment in which focus-time is installed ('focus-time', 'focus-session', and 'python -m focus.session' all work as well):
```py
focus
```
2. Type in how long you would like to focus for in minutes (e.g. 60) and press enter. This is the desired amount of high-quality _focus_ time; if you are distracted, the session will take longer in real time.
```
-- How long would you like to focus for? (minutes)          60

-- Starting focus session for 60 minutes of quality time (up to 90 minutes of real time)
   2021-11-13 10:38:33.599973
```
3. Every once and a while, a prompt will pop up along with a "ding-dong!" reminder, asking if you were actually focusing (e.g. writing your book) as opposed to something else (e.g. texting). If you were not focusing, make sure the terminal is selected and press any key. This will not count the previous period toward your focus-time total.
- The inter-ding-dong interval is selected from an exponentially decaying distribution. This means that at any point in time, the probability that the reminder will come soon is about the same. Slacking off right after a reminder won't work!
- If you are using this as a meditation timer, just use the sounds as a reminder to focus, without pressing anything.
```
-- Were you focusing? If yes, carry on. If no, press any key within 15 seconds
   Great job! 36% complete*
```
*This is what you'll see if you do not press a key within 15 seconds

4. Step 3 will repeat until you have achieved at least 100% of your desired focus time - you will be notified and the session will end. If you pass the maximum amount of real time (here, 90 minutes), you will be notified of that as well.
```
You did it!!!
```

## Focus day

1. How about a whole day's worth of focus time? Enter the following command instead ('python -m focus.day' works as well):
```
focus-day
```
2. Write how long you'd like to focus for today and press enter. This will be spread throughout multiple focus sessions.
```
-- How long would you like to focus for today? (hours)      7
```
3. This will trigger a series of focus sessions (see above). Upon completion of each session, you'll be notified of how much time you have to go, and you can start a new session whenever you're ready.
```
   You have 6.3 hours to go. When you're ready let's start session number 2!

-- How long would you like to focus for? (minutes) 
```
4. If, upon completion of one of these focus sessions, you surpass your goal for the day, you will be notified and summarily congratulated.
